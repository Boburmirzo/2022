# Observe your API with an API Gateway Plugins

We know that an API gateway offers a central control point for incoming traffic to a variety of destinations but it can also be a central point for observation as well since it is uniquely qualified to know about all the traffic moving between clients and our service networks. Instead of spending time integrating your services with other many tools and technologies to improve observability, you can easily manage all work with Apache APISIX Plugins.

The core of observability breaks down into three key areas: structured logs, metrics, and traces. In this talk, we will walk through each pillar of API observability and we will learn how with Apache APISIX Plugins we can simplify these tasks.

Most observability platforms like (Prometheus, Skywalking, Opentelemetry, etc.) provide pre-built connectors and we will describe how you can easily integrate your API log data further derive useful metrics, and gain complete visibility into the usage, performance, and security of your APIs in your environment.
