## Terraform Infrastructure as Code: Best Practices and Common Mistakes

Terraform is one of the most common coding platforms for managing cloud infrastructure as code. I have been using Terraform to manage infrastructure on the cloud for several years now. Additionally, I coach DevOps teams in large enterprises that implement 100% infrastructure as code. Everything in this presentation comes from experience. I'll guide you through a series of best practices including source code management, environment management, execution through pipelines, modularizing Terraform code so it can be reused across the enterprise, and much more. Additionally, I'll review common mistakes and anti-patterns so you can avoid them.

This session is targeted at DevOps and DevSecOps professionals and team leads. This presentation will be ground-level and contain several coding examples. Attendees with knowledge of Terraform basics will get the most benefit.

## Getting up to speed: Application Deployment Patterns in the Cloud

With the cloud (it doesn't matter which cloud vendor), application infrastructure is entirely software now. That is, application infrastructure and software releases can be entirely programmed and releases managed using CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, the cloud allows developers and architects ways to release software in ways that eliminate user downtime and reduce deployment risk. Application release patterns presented will include canary releases, blue/green releases, rolling updates, and more.

This presentation targets application architects and developers with experience writing pipelines to deploy applications to the cloud. While I tend to draw on Jenkins and AWS for examples, the patterns described here apply to any CI/CD toolset (e. g. Jenkins, Bamboo, Azure DevOps, etc.) and to any cloud vendor (AWS, Azure, etc.). Attendees will walk away with an understanding of each release pattern and when the use of them is appropriate.
