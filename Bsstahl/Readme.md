## Design Patterns for Loosely Coupled Applications

Building loosely coupled applications is critical to creating solutions that follow good object oriented principles. These principles help make sure our applications are testable, maintainable and extensible. In this session we explore several design patterns that are key to building applications that maintain loose coupling. We start by reviewing a tightly coupled application. Then, we explore several critical design patterns by using them to convert the application into a maintainable and extensible solution that can be validated using unit tests.

## Defining the Business Domain using Event Storming [Full-Day Workshop]

Event storming is a process for modeling a business domain from the perspective of the business experts. It has been used by many with great success. Event Storming can help your team:

* Build an understanding of a domain
* Define the scopes and interactions of the components of a system
* Rapidly discover unknown-unknowns
* Expose the intricacies of the business domain
* Identify the areas of greatest risk

The artifacts produced in this process are useful to both the business experts, to help document their domain, and the engineers building systems for that domain.

In this session, we explore the process of Event Storming. We define the goals and expected outputs of the process, and walk through a simple example so that you are ready to bring this important process into your organization.
